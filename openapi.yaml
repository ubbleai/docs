    # Introduction
    [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com/)'s Identity Verification solution enables you to verify your users' identities
    to meet compliance requirements and reduce the risk of fraud.
    
    To integrate Identity Verification and configure your account, reach out to your Account Manager or support.idv@checkout.com.

    The following represents a typical identity verification flow:

     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubbleai/docs/main/intro_diagram.png" alt="intro_diagram" width="800" height="auto">

    1. **You create an applicant, an identity verification and an attempt.** You can use the RESTful endpoints or the helper. You'll receive a unique URL that you need to redirect the user to.
    2. **You redirect the user.** You have full control over how to [manage the verification redirection](#section/Manage-verification-redirection) to ensure a smooth user experience.
    The user performs verification on their mobile device. They'll use their device camera to scan their face and documents. 
    3. **You'll receive the [verification results](#section/Handle-verification-results) via a [webhook](#section/Webhooks).** You can also
    request more detailed results via the [API](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/retrieve_identity_verification),
    or download a [PDF report](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/pdf_identity_verification).
    4. **You decide on follow-up actions based on the verification results.** You can also reattempt the identity verification if required.

    # Get started
    Use the Identity Verification API and sandbox environment to test the identity verification process.

    ## Before you begin
    - Make sure you have a [test account](https://dashboard.ubble.ai/) and credentials. Open the [dashboard](https://dashboard.ubble.ai/)
    and navigate to the "API credentials" tab to create your credentials and your certificate. If you need an account, please contact support.idv@checkout.com.
    - We use mutual Transport Layer Security. You must then authenticate your calls by including your mTLS certificate in API calls.
    - To receive notifications for the various identity verification events triggered throughout the steps, you will need to define a
    webhook url. For security reasons all our webhook calls are signed, can be whitelisted or can even request an authentication.
    You will find all details about webhook implementation in the [webhook section](#section/Webhooks).
    - You'll also need to provide a redirect URL. The user will be redirected to this URL once verification is completed.

    ## Step 1: Create and start an identity verification
    
    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #cfe5ff; border-color: #f8c92e; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; vertical-align: center;">ⓘ</div>
      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
        <p>To create the first attempt and get the verification_url you can use the RESTful endpoints or the helper described here. To create the subsequent attempts, we strongly recommend the use of the create an attempt endpoint.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    ### Request example
    
    <div style="padding: 1em; background-color: #fafafa; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <span type="post" class="sc-EgOXT hniGzf http-verb post">post</span>
      <span class="sc-ejfMa-d jgeKJH">/v2/create-and-start-idv</span>
    </div>

    ```json
    {
      "declared_data": {
        "name": "David Vincent"
      },
      "webhook_url": "https://my.api/events/",
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello"
    }
    ```

    ### Response example

    ```json
    {
      "id": "idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "created_on": "2017-07-21T17:32:28Z",
      "modified_on": "2017-07-21T17:40:32Z",
      "user_journey_id": "usj_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "applicant_id": "aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "status": "pending",
      "response_codes": [],
      "declared_data": {
        "name": "David Vincent",
        "birth_date": "1934-10-02"
      },
      "documents": [],
      "webhook_url": "https://my.api/events/",
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello",
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.ubble.ai/v2/identity-verifications/idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we"
        },
        "applicant": {
          "href": "https://api.ubble.ai/v2/applicants/aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we"
        },
        "verification_url": {
          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Make a note of the identity verification `id` value in the response. You'll need it to retrieve the detailed verification results later.

    For more details, see our the [CREATE AND START AN IDENTITY VERIFICATION endpoint.](#tag/Identity-verifications).

    ## Step 2: Perform a test verification

    The identity verification response contains a `_links.verification_url.href` field. You should send the user to this URL to redirect them to the Identity Verification web application.

    To test this step, open the URL on your browser and follow the instructions displayed.
    
    ## Step 3: Verify webhook notifications

    If you've configured your webhook receiver, you'll be notified of events that occur during the identity verification flow via webhooks. Among other information, the webhooks will contain:
    - the event `type` - for example, `identity_verification_capture_completed` or `identity_verification_retry_requested`
    - the identity verification `status` - for example, `capture_in_progress`, `approved`, or `declined`

    ### Webhook example

    ```json
    {
        "specversion": "2.0",
        "type": "identity_verification_capture_completed",
        "subject": "idv_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
        "id": "evnt_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
        "time": "2023-03-22T17:31:00Z",
        "datacontenttype": "application/json",
        "data": {
            "applicant_id": "aplt_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
            "user_journey_id": "usj_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
            "identity_verification_id": "idv_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
            "status": "declined",
            "response_codes": [
                {"code": 61310, "summary": "document_front_not_captured"},
                {"code": 62102, "summary": "document_not_accepted"}
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    Wait until you've received a webhook with the `status` field set to one of the following values before continuing to the next step:
    - `approved`
    - `declined`
    - `retry_required`

    ## Step 4: Retrieve detailed verification results

    To retrieve the detailed verification results, call the following endpoint with the identity verification id value returned in the Request an identity verification response. 

    ### Response example

    <div style="padding: 1em; background-color: #fafafa; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">

    For more details, see our the [retrieve an identity verification endpoint](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/retrieve_identity_verification). 

    # Manage applicant redirection
    
    When you request an [identity verification](#section/Get-Started), you’ll receive a `verification_url` in the response. Redirect your user to this URL so they can perform the verification.

    To ensure a smooth user experience, you can control how the redirection is handled.
    
    ## URL expiration and attempt creation
    
    For security purposes, URLs generated for user verification expire after 15 minutes. To ensure applicants are consistently redirected to a valid URL, it is strongly recommended to create a new attempt each time a user initiates the verification process.
    
    ## Pre-select customer details
    
    To enhance the security and user experience, you can pre-select customer details when creating an attempt for the verification request. We highly recommend using the RESTful endpoints for creating the applicant, initiating the identity verification, and then creating the attempt.

    ## Customize the verification user experience

    Contact your Account Manager or support.idv@checkout.com to customize the verification user experience.

    You can <a href="https://www.ubble.ai/customise-your-ubble-experience/" target="_blank">customize</a> the following elements on the verification screen displayed to your users:
    - logo
    - colors
    - fonts
    - button radius
    - message prompt text

    ## Redirect to mobile for verification

    All desktop users are redirected to their mobile device to perform verification. This allows the verification to be performed in a more secure environment, and ensures that users are more likely to complete the verification journey.

    After a user has completed the verification on their mobile, we redirect them back to their desktop environment by providing them with a QR code or SMS link.

    For the SMS link, you can provide a `phone_number` value in your [identity verification request](#operation/create_identity_verification) to pre-fill the phone number associated with the redirection.

    ## Redirect using web redirection (Optional)

    For web redirection, we support the following environments and minimum browser versions:

    | Desktop      | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Internet Explorer | Edge | Opera |
    |--------------|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|------|-------|
    | Min. Version | ≥ 53   | ≥ 52    | ≥ 11.1 | -                 | ≥ 16 | ≥ 58  |

    | Android      | Chrome for Android | Firefox for Android | Samsung Internet | IE Mobile |
    |--------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------|
    | Min. Version | ≥ 73               | ≥ 66                | ≥ 6.2            | -         |

    | iOS          | Safari Mobile | Chrome | All other browsers |
    |--------------|---------------|--------|--------------------|
    | Min. Version | ≥ 11.0        | ≥ 14.3 | -                  |

    After you create an identity verification in your backend, you can integrate it within your website by passing the `verificationUrl` to your web app and adding it as a link:

    ```html
    <a href="`${verificationUrl}`"></a>
    ```

    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #cfe5ff; border-color: #f8c92e; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; vertical-align: center;">ⓘ</div>
      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
        <p>You can view an <a href="https://github.com/ubbleai/integration_examples/tree/master/web" target="_blank">example web integration</a> on our Identity Verification GitHub repository.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    ### Handle user return in web redirection

    When the user completes or terminates their verification, they’ll be redirected to the `redirect_url` you specified when you requested an identity verification.

    The event associated with the user’s verification is returned in the webhook notification, and as a URL parameter in the `redirect_url`. If verification was unsuccessful, the URL will also contain a `response_code` URL parameter. For example:

    ```
    https://your-redirect-url.com?id=idv_01h2623ysfkhpn7czed0bw8fd6&event=identity_verification_capture_aborted&response_code=61101
    ```

    Your follow-up action is determined by the [webhook event](#section/Webhooks/Events) you receive:

    <table style="width: 100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 40%" scope="col">Webhook event</th>
          <th style="width: 60%" scope="col">Follow-up action</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p>
              <code>identity_verification_capture_aborted</code> or
              <code>identity_verification_link_expired</code>
            </p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>
              Request a
              <a
                href="#operation/retry_identity_verification"
                target="_self"
                >retry</a
              >.
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_refused</code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>Propose an alternative verification method to the user.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_completed </code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>
              You can ask users to perform additional checks or ask them to wait
              until results are available. In some instances, you may also
              simultaneously receive an
              <code>identity_verification_checks_completed</code> webhook.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can make your decision once you receive the
              <code>identity_verification_checks_completed</code> webhook.
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>


    ## Redirect using webview (Optional)

    For a more integrated redirection from your mobile application, you can redirect the user with a webview. Webview redirection is supported by the following platforms:
    - Android
    - iOS 13 or later – via WebRTC running inside a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview" target="_blank">WKWebView</a>
    - iOS 12 or older – via the Safari browser by passing the `verificationUrl` to the `UIApplication.open()`
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1648685-open" target="_blank">method</a> in your app code
    - React Native
    - Flutter – using the `flutter_inappwebview` <a href="https://inappwebview.dev/docs/intro/" target="_blank">dependency</a>,
    with the <a href="https://inappwebview.dev/docs/web-rtc/" target="_blank">WebRTC API</a> so Identity Verification can launch a video stream

    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #cfe5ff; border-color: #f8c92e; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; vertical-align: center;">ⓘ</div>
      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
        <p>You can view <a href="https://github.com/ubbleai/integration_examples/tree/master" target="_blank">example webview integrations</a> for each platform on our Identity Verification GitHub repository.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    With a webview integration, you’re expected to provide a deeplink to redirect the user on your mobile application.

    ### Handle user return in webview

    When the user completes or terminates their verification, they’ll be redirected to the `redirect_url` you specified when you requested an identity verification.

    The event associated with the user’s verification is returned in the webhook notification, and as a URL parameter in the `redirect_url`. If verification was unsuccessful, the URL will also contain a `response_code` URL parameter. For example:

    ```
    https://your-redirect-url.com?id=idv_01h2623ysfkhpn7czed0bw8fd6&event=identity_verification_capture_aborted&response_code=61101
    ```

    Your follow-up action is determined by the [webhook event](#section/Webhooks/Events) you receive:

    <table style="width: 100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 40%" scope="col">Webhook event</th>
          <th style="width: 60%" scope="col">Follow-up action</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 387.359px">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_aborted</code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 491.641px">
            <p>
              Request a
              <a
                href="#operation/retry_identity_verification"
                >retry.
              </a>
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_refused</code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>Propose an alternative verification method to the user.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_completed </code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>
              You can ask users to perform additional checks, or ask them to wait
              until results are available. In some instances, you may also
              simultaneously receive an
              <code>identity_verification_checks_completed</code> webhook.
            </p>

    ## Redirect using an iframe (Optional)

    If you use desktop to mobile redirection, we recommend using our iframe integration.

    Include the SDK as a script tag:

    ```html
    <script
      src="https://cdn.ubble.ai/iframe-sdk-1.0.0.js"
      type="application/javascript"
    ></script>
    ```

    Add a global method called `onUbbleReady` to the page. The method should be triggered when the SDK is loaded:

    ```js
    function onUbbleReady() {

    }
    ```

    Initialize a new `IDV` object:

    ```js
    function onUbbleReady() {
      const ubbleIDV = new Ubble.IDV(document.getElementById("ubble"), options);
    }
    ```

    ### API

    #### Events

    `onComplete(completeEvent)`: Triggered when a user completes the capture

    ```json
    {
      "event": "capture_completion",
      "redirectUrl": "https://your-redirect-url.com?id=<identity verification id>&event=identity_verification_capture_completed"
    }
    ```

    `onRefused(refusedEvent)`: Triggered when the applicant refuses to complete the verification

    ```json
    {
      "event": "capture_refusal",
      "responseCode": 63001,
      "redirectUrl": "https://your-redirect-url.com?id=<identity verification id>&event=identity_verification_capture_refused"
    }
    ```

    `onAbort(abortEvent)`: Triggered when the verification is terminated

    ```json
    {
      "event": "capture_abortion",
      "responseCode": 61111,
      "redirectUrl": "https://your-redirect-url.com?id=<identity verification id>&event=identity_verification_capture_aborted&response_code=63001"
    }
    ```

    `onExpired`: Triggered when the verification link has expired

    ```json
    {
      "event": "expiration",
      "redirectUrl": "https://your-redirect-url.com?id=<identity verification id>&event=identity_verification_link_expired&response_code=63001"
    }
    ```

    #### Methods

    `destroy()`: Ends the Identity Verification flow

    #### Full example

    ```js
    const ubbleIDV = new Ubble.IDV("idv", {
      width: "500",
      height: "600",
      allowCamera: true,
      verificationUrl: "https://idv.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5",
      events: {
        onComplete(event) {
          ubbleIDV.destroy();
        },
        onAbort(event) {
          ubbleIDV.destroy();
        },
        onExpired(event) {
          ubbleIDV.destroy();
        }
        onRefused(event) {
          ubbleIDV.destroy();
        }
      },
    });
    ```

      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
        <p>
        If you encounter issues, ensure that you've:

          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    #### Handle user redirection in iframe

    When the user completes or terminates their verification, use the `destroy()` method for handling user redirection.

    # Handle verification results
    
    ## Lifecycle
    
    ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubbleai/docs/main/life_cycle_diagram.png)

    When you request an identity verification, you'll be notified about events throughout the verification's lifecycle via webhooks.
    
    ## Verification statuses

    The webhooks also return the current `status` of the identity verification. The follow-up action you should take depends on the `status` value returned:

    <table style="width: 100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 25%" scope="col">Status</th>

    ## Response codes
    
    If the status of the attempt is `completed`, `expired`, `capture_aborted` and `checks_inconclusive`, 
    you will also get additional information with the `response_codes` attribute. Response codes associated with 
    the last attempt are also available in the `identity_verification` endpoints and in the webhook body. 
    It will include both a numeric code and a string, as detailed in the example below:

    ```json
    "response-codes": [
      {"code": 61310, "summary": "document_front_not_captured"},
      {"code": 62102, "summary": "document_not_accepted"},
    ]
    ```

    You will find below the exhaustive list of these codes.

    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #fff6d9; border-color: #f8c92e; color: #666; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; color: #f8c92e; vertical-align: center;">⚠</div>
      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
        <p>
          Please note that we consider adding new response codes as backward compatible.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    You should then build you business rules based on the status and use response codes as additional information, rather than use response codes as required information.

        }
    }
    ```

    For more details, see [retrieve identity-verification documentation](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/retry_identity_verification).

    We recommend that you use the response codes to guide the user. For example, if the [response codes](#section/Handle-verification-results/Response-codes)
    indicate that the connection of the user is not sufficient, you should give this information to the user.

    ## Retrieve a PDF report

    When you receive an `identity_verification_checks_completed` webhook, we'll simultaneously generate a PDF report with detailed results of the identity verification.

    When the PDF report is ready for you to [retrieve via the API](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/pdf_identity_verification),
    you'll receive an `identity_verification_report_created` webhook.

    Please note that the generated reports are signed. In order to check the signature, you should use our [public certificate](s3://cdn.ubble.ai/cko_idv_api_signature_public_certificate.crt). We follow the PDF signature standard, where all information necessary is embedded 
    in the metadata, which is recognized by most PDF readers.
    You can find an example on how to validate the signature [here](https://github.com/ubbleai/code-samples).

    ## Data management

    You can configure data retention together with your account manager, in accordance with your purpose for using the data. At the end of this time, the identity verifications are anonymized, which means all personal or sensitive data are deleted. The default storage time is 90 days.
    
    If needed, you can also request the anonymization of an identity verification through the [anonymization endpoint](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/anonymize_identity_verification). 

    # AML Verification (BETA)
    
    In partnership with ComplyAdvantage, we propose an Identity verification and AML screening bundle. After having verified the applicant's identity you will be able to:  
    
    Search them in the Politically Exposed Person (PEP) lists, Sanction lists and Adverse media database,
    
    Get a risk score based on a customized model,
    
    Manually investigate cases,
    
    Monitor an applicant and get notified if an alert is raised.
    
    Please note that this offer is only available if you subscribed to both services, reach out your account manager if you have any questions.
    
    ## Create an AML verification
    
    To use it, you will first need an `applicant_id` and an approved identity verification. 

    You can then request an AML verification and include the following fields:
    
    - `applicant_id` - the unique identifier of the applicant.
    
    - `webhook_url` - the URL where you want to be notified when the status of the AML verification change.
    
    - `screening_configuration_identifier` - the identifier of the configuration you want to use to screen the applicant. It can be defined and retrieved via the ComplyAdvantage dashboard.

    </div>
    
    Request example

    ```json
    {
        "webhook_url": "{{WEBHOOK_URL}}",
        "applicant_id": "aplt_01hr4p9j0etqw34wyv2h4ac27k",
        "search_parameters": {
            "configuration_identifier": "e3b6c5b6-fcc2-43e3-9e8c-7e378e320a2p"
        },
    }
    ```
    
    Response example
    
    ```json
    {
        "id": "amlv_01hr7269mkxva7msc443jz4jbf",
        "applicant_id": "aplt_01hr7269ksxqjgqxbh4vaqmry8",
        "created_on": "2024-03-05T10:22:48.481031Z",
        "modified_on": "2024-03-05T10:22:49.327277Z",
        "status": "review_required",
        "webhook_url": "https://my.api/events/",
        "monitored": false,
        "search_parameters": {
            "configuration_identifier": "e3b6c5b6-fcc2-43e3-9e8c-7e378e320a2p"
        },
        "_links": {
            "self": {
                "href": "https://api.ubble.ai/api/v2/aml-verifications/amlv_01hr7269mkxva7msc443jz4jbf"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Make a note of the AML verification `id` value in the response. You'll need this to retrieve the detailed results later.
    
    ## Set up an initial risk scoring 
    
    You can get an initial risk scoring based on a model that you can customize in the ComplyAdvantage dashboard. 
    
    The applicant will then be scored before the AML verification has been performed. The result of this scoring will be available as a `risk_level` in the results and can be one of `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH` or `PROHIBITED`.
    
    If the risk level is `PROHIBITED`, the AML verification is not performed and the `status` is declined. If the risk level is `LOW`, `MEDIUM` or `HIGH`, the AML verification will be performed and the results will depend on raised alerts. See below for more details.
    
    ## Verify webhook notification
    
    You'll be notified of events that occur during the AML verification process via webhooks. Among other information, the webhooks will contain:
    
    - the event `type` - for example, `aml_verification_created`,
    
    - the AML verification `status` - for example, `created` or `review_required`.
    
    Example
    
    ```json
    {
      "specversion": "2.0",
      "type": "aml_verification_created",
      "subject": "amlv_01hr7269mkxva7msc443jz4jbf",
      "id": "evnt_01hr7269ry3g8skc630q4ec75g",
      "time": "2024-03-05T10:22:48Z",
      "datacontenttype": "application/json",
      "data": {
        "aml_verification_id": "amlv_01hr7269mkxva7msc443jz4jbf",
        "status": "created",
        "applicant_id": "aplt_01hr7269ksxqjgqxbh4vaqmry8"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    When the AML verification is completed, you will receive a webhook notification with the event `type` field set to `aml_verification_completed`, and the body will include the `status` of the AML verification. See the section below.
    
    ## Handle AML verification results
    
    The webhooks also return the current `status` of the AML verification. The follow-up action you should take depends on the `status` value returned:
    
    | <div style="width:12em">Status</div>     | Description                                                                                              | Recommended action                    |
    |------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
    | `created`                                | The AML verification has been created.                                                                   | Wait for a change in `status`.        |
    | `screening_in_progress`                  | The risk scoring or AML verification is in progress.                                                     | Wait for a change in `status`.        |
    | `approved`                               | The initial risk scoring is not `PROHIBITED` and there are no alerts.                                     | Accept the applicant’s request.       |
    | `declined`                               | The initial risk scoring is `PROHIBITED`.                                                                | Refuse the applicant’s request.       |
    | `review_required`                        | The initial risk scoring is not `PROHIBITED` but there are screening alerts and a case has been created. | Manually investigate the case.        |
    
    You can also get this status by calling the following endpoint with the unique `id` returned in the create AML verification response:
    
    <div style="padding: 1em; background-color: #fafafa; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <span type="get" class="sc-EgOXT dzbTKB http-verb get">get</span>
      <span class="sc-ejfMa-d jgeKJH">/v2/aml-verifications/{aml_verification_id}</span>
    </div>
    
    Response example
    
    ```json
    {
        "id": "amlv_01hr7269mkxva7msc443jz4jbf",
        "applicant_id": "aplt_01hr7269ksxqjgqxbh4vaqmry8",
        "created_on": "2024-03-05T10:22:48.481031Z",
        "modified_on": "2024-03-05T10:22:49.327277Z",
        "status": "review_required",
        "webhook_url": "https://my.api/events/",
        "monitored": false,
        "search_parameters": {
            "configuration_identifier": "e3b6c5b6-fcc2-43e3-9e8c-7e378e320a2p"
        },
        "_links": {
            "self": {
                "href": "https://myweb.site/?query-param=hello"
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Manually investigate the results
    
    If the `status` is `review_required` you might want to investigate the case and determine if the applicant can access your service or not. You can do it via the ComplyAdvantage case management tool. 
    
    You will be able to review the alerts and to determine if you accept the risk associated to the case or not.
    
    If you accept it, the status will switch to `approved`.
    
    If you refuse it, the status will switch to `declined`.
    
    You will be notified if you change the `status` of an AML verification. The `event_type` field will be set to `aml_onboarding_review_completed` and the body will include the new `status`.
    
    Example
    
    ```json
    {
      "specversion": "2.0",
      "type": "aml_onboarding_review_completed",
      "subject": "amlv_01hr7269mkxva7msc443jz4jbf",
      "id": "evnt_01hr7269ry3g8skc630q4ec75g",
      "time": "2024-03-05T10:22:48Z",
      "datacontenttype": "application/json",
      "data": {
        "status": approved,
      }
    }
    ```

    ## Monitor a search
    
    If an applicant is monitored, you be notified if an alert is raised. 
    
    The `status` of the AML verification will switch to `review_required`.
    
    In this case, you will get a notification with the `event_type` field set to `aml_monitoring_alert` and the body will include the new `status`.
    
    You can then use the ComplyAdvantage case management tool to manually investigate the results. 
    
    When the review is completed, you will get a notification with the `event_type` field set to `aml_monitoring_review_completed` and the body will include the new `status, depending of you decision to accept or not the risk related to the monitoring case.
    
    # Face Authentication (Coming soon)
    
    You may want to verify that a person is the same person who performed the identity verification. 

    To make this additional verification easy, we propose a face authentication product: users will have to present their face and we will compare it with the one we captured during the verification process.
    
    ## Create a face authentication
    
    To request an identity verification, you must include the following fields
    
    - `applicant_id` - the unique identifier of the applicant.
    
    - `webhook_url` - the URL to get notifications.
    
    - `user_journey_id` - dedicated configuration to customize the authentication
    
    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #fff6d9; border-color: #f8c92e; color: #666; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
    <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; color: #f8c92e; vertical-align: center;">⚠</div>
    <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
      <p>Please note that for the request to be accepted the applicant should be associated with a verified face video and this one should not have been anonymised. A verified face video can be obtained through an approved identity verification or a previous face authentication. Contact your account manager to adapt your data retention time. </p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    ## Create an attempt
    
    Once you get the `face_authentication_id` you can use it to create an attempt and get a `verification_url`. 

    To request an identity verification, you must include the following fields:
    
    - `face_authentication_id` - the identifier of the face authentication
    
    - `redirect_url` - the URL to redirect the user to once face authentication is completed
    
    ## Verify webhook notification
    
    You will be notified of events that occur during the face authentication process via webhooks. Among other information, webhooks will contain:    
    - the event `type` - for example, `face_authentication_started`,
    
    - the face authentication `status` - for example, `capture_in_progress` or `approved`.
    
    - the face authentication `response_codes`.
    
    Example
    
    ```json
    {
      "specversion": "2.0",
      "type": "face_authentication_created",
      "subject": "fav_01hr7269mkxva7msc443jz4jbf",
      "id": "evnt_01hr7269ry3g8skc630q4ec75g",
      "time": "2024-03-05T10:22:48Z",
      "datacontenttype": "application/json",
      "data": {
        "face_authentication_id": "fav_01hr7269mkxva7msc443jz4jbf",
        "status": "created",
        "applicant_id": "aplt_01hr7269ksxqjgqxbh4vaqmry8"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ## Retrieve detailed authentication results
    
    To retrieve detailed results about a face authentication, call the following endpoint with the 
    
    unique id returned in the POST Request a face authentication response:
    
    <div style="padding: 1em; background-color: #fafafa; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">

          }
        }
      }
    ```
    
    ## Create a new attempt
    When the face authentication status is `retry_required`, you should create a new attempt. See the dedicated section. 
    
    We recommend that you use the response codes to guide the user. 
    
    For example, if the response codes indicate that the connection of the user is not sufficient, you should give this information to the user.
    
    # Webhooks

    ## Configuration

    When [creating an identity verification](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/create_identity_verification), you need to provide the webhook url you want to be notified on.

    You will be notified of each event on identity verifications. For more details see the event section.

    To help you integrate your webhook you can trigger it with the standard answers, see [notify endpoint](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/notify_identity_verification).

    ## Retry

    We expect that you will return us a 200 or 201 status code within 10 seconds before we retry, up to 2 retries will be performed. If needed, you can trigger webhook notifications manually using the [notify endpoint](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/notify_identity_verification).

    ## Signature
    For security reasons all our webhook calls are signed, please refer to [signature](#section/Signature) for more details.

    ## Security

    ### Webhook IP whitelisting

    For security purposes, if you need to whitelist our incoming api calls, see our [public ip addresses](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/OUTSCALE-Public-IPs.html).

    # Testing
    
    Use the following examples to test different Identity Verification scenarios.
    
    ## Successful verification
    
    ### Step 1: Configure webhooks
    
    Have your webhook server ready to test real-time notifications for each event in this scenario.
    - identity_verification_created
    - identity_verification_opened
    - identity_verification_started
    - identity_verification_capture_completed
    - identity_verification_checks_completed
    
    ### Step 2: Create an applicant
    
    Set the `external_applicant_id` value to `eaplt_10000000000000000000000000`.
    
    <div style="padding: 1em; background-color: #fafafa; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <span type="post" class="sc-EgOXT hniGzf http-verb post">post</span>
      <span class="sc-ejfMa-d jgeKJH">/v2/applicants</span>
    </div>
    
    #### Request example
    
    ```json
    {
      "external_applicant_id": "eaplt_10000000000000000000000000",
      "email": "toby.arden@example.com"
    }
    ```
    
    #### Response example
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "created_on": "2023-07-21T17:32:28Z",
      "modified_on": "2023-07-21T17:40:32Z",

        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 3: Create an identity verification
    
    Set the `id` you received in the step 1 response as the `applicant_id` value. For example, in this case the response returned `aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we` as the `id`.

          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 4: Create an attempt
    
    Pass the `id` value from step 2 response as the `identity_verification_id` path parameter.
    
    For example, in this case the `id` value returned is `idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we`.

        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    At this stage, the webhooks are triggered. The `identity_verification_checks_completed` webhook will return the response code `10000`
    
    ### (Optional) Step 5: Retrieve an identity verification
    
    Pass the `id` value from step 2 response to the `identity_verification_id` path parameter.

    ```
    
    ## Successful verification on retry after capture aborted
    
    ### Step 1: Configure webhooks
    
    Set up webhooks to test real-time notifications for each event in this scenario. 
    
    Webhooks for first attempt:
    
      - identity_verification_created
      - identity_verification_opened
      - identity_verification_started
      - identity_verification_capture_aborted
    
    Webhooks for final verdict:
    
      - identity_verification_retry_requested
      - identity_verification_started
      - identity_verification_capture_completed
      - identity_verification_checks_completed
    
    ### Step 2: Create an applicant
    
    Set the value of `external_applicant_id` as `eaplt_61XXXA10000000000000000000`. Replace `61XXX` with any of the response codes starting with 61, that you would like to test for.
    
    For example, if you would like to test with response code `61401`, set the `external_application_id` to `eaplt_61401A10000000000000000000`.

      <span class="sc-ejfMa-d jgeKJH">/v2/applicants</span>
    </div>
    
    #### Request example
    
    ```json
    {
      "external_applicant_id": "eaplt_61401A10000000000000000000",
      "email": "jia.tsang@example.com"
    }
    ```
    
    #### Response example
    
    ```json

        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 3: Create an identity verification
    
    Set the `id` you received in the step 1 response as the `applicant_id` value. For example, in this case the response returned `aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr8hg` as the id.

      "documents": [],
      "redirect_url": "https://example.com?query-param=hello",
      "webhook_url": "https://my.api/events/",
      "_links": {
        "self": {

        "verification_url": {
          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 4: Create an attempt
    
    Pass the `id` value from step 2 response as the `identity_verification_id` path parameter.
    
    For example, in this case the `id` value returned is `idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr8hg`.

      <span class="sc-ejfMa-d jgeKJH">/v2/identity-verifications/{identity_verification_id}/attempts</span>
    </div>
    
    #### Request example
    
    ```json
    {
        "phone_number": {
          "country_code": "+1",
          "number": "5555500102"
        },
        "redirect_url": "https://example.com?query-param=hello"
    }
    ```
    
    #### Response example
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "iatp_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabrPoQ",
      "created_on": "2023-07-21T17:32:28Z",
      "modified_on": "2023-07-21T17:40:32Z",
      "phone_number": {
        "country_code": "+1",
        "number": "5555500102"
      },
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello",
      "status": "capture_in_progress",
      "response_codes": [],
      "_links": {

          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    At this stage, the webhooks for the first attempt are triggered. The `identity_verification_capture_aborted` webhook will return the response code starting with 61, that you passed as part of the `external_applicant_id`.
    
    
    ### Step 5: Create another attempt
    
    When the `identity_verification_capture_aborted` webhook returns the `retry_required` status, create another attempt.
    
    Set the `id` value from step 2 response as the `identity_verification_id` path parameter. For example, in this case the `id` value returned is `idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr8hg`.

        },
        "redirect_url": "https://example.com?query-param=hello"
    }
    ```
    
    #### Response example
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "iatp_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabrPoQ",

      "modified_on": "2023-07-21T17:40:32Z",
      "phone_number": {
        "country_code": "+1",
        "number": "5555500102"
      },
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello",
      "status": "capture_in_progress",
      "response_codes": [],
      "_links": {
        "verification_url": {
          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    At this stage, webhooks for the final verdict are triggered. The `identity_verification_checks_completed` webhook will return the response code `10000`.


    ### (Optional) Step 6: Retrieve an identity verification
    
    Pass the `id` value from step 2 response to the `identity_verification_id` path parameter.

    ## Successful verification on retry after checks inconclusive
    
    ### Step 1: Configure webhooks
    
    Have your webhook server ready to test real-time notifications for each event in this scenario. 
    
    Webhooks for first attempt:
    
      - identity_verification_created
      - identity_verification_opened
      - identity_verification_started
      - identity_verification_capture_completed
      - identity_verification_checks_inconclusive
    
    Webhooks for final verdict:
    
      - identity_verification_retry_requested
      - identity_verification_started
      - identity_verification_capture_completed
      - identity_verification_checks_completed
    
    ### Step 2: Create an applicant
    
    Set the value of `external_applicant_id` as `eaplt_61XXXA10000000000000000000`. Replace `61XXX` with any of the response codes starting with 61, that you would like to test for.
    
    For example, if you would like to test with response code `61310`, set the `external_application_id` to `eaplt_61310A10000000000000000000`.

      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 3: Create an identity verification
    
    Set the `id` you received in the step 1 response as the `applicant_id` value. For example, in this case the response returned `aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7wf` as the id.

        },
        "redirect_url": "https://example.com?query-param=hello"
    }
    ```
    
    #### Response example
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "iatp_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabrPoQ",
      "created_on": "2023-07-21T17:32:28Z",
      "modified_on": "2023-07-21T17:40:32Z",
      "phone_number": {

          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    At this stage, the webhooks for the first attempt are triggered. The `identity_verification_checks_inconclusive` webhook will return the response code starting with 61, that you passed as part of the `external_applicant_id`.
    
    
    ### Step 5: Create another attempt
    
    When the `identity_verification_checks_inconclusive` webhook returns the `retry_required` status, create another attempt.
    
    Set the `id` value from step 2 response as the `identity_verification_id` path parameter. For example, in this case the `id` value returned is `idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7wf`.

          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    At this stage, webhooks for the final verdict are triggered. The `identity_verification_checks_inconclusive` webhook will return the response code starting with 61 that you passed as part of the `external_applicant_id`.


    ### (Optional) Step 6: Retrieve an identity verification
    
    Pass the `id` value from step 2 response to the `identity_verification_id` path parameter.

    ## Declined verification
    
    ### Step 1: Configure webhooks
    
    Set up webhooks to test real-time notifications for each event in this scenario.
    
    For first attempt:
    
      - identity_verification_created
      - identity_verification_opened
      - identity_verification_started
      - identity_verification_capture_completed
      - identity_verification_checks_completed
    
    ### Step 2: Create an applicant
    
    Set the `external_applicant_id` value to `eaplt_62XXX000000000000000000000`. 
    Replace `62XXX` with any of the response codes starting with 62, that you would like to test for.
    
    For example, if you would like to test with `62201`, then set the value to `eaplt_62201000000000000000000000`

      <span class="sc-ejfMa-d jgeKJH">/v2/applicants</span>
    </div>
    
    #### Request example
    
    ```json
    {
      "external_applicant_id": "eaplt_62201000000000000000000000",
      "email": "hannah.bret@example.com"
    }
    ```
    
    #### Response example

        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 3: Create an identity verification
    
    Set the `id` you received in the step 1 response as the `applicant_id` value. For example, in this case the response returned `aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr9fr` as the `id`.

        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 4: Create an attempt
    
    Pass the `id` from step 2 response as the path parameter.
    
    For example, in this case the response returned `idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr1ab` as the `id`.

      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello"
    }
    ```   
    #### Response example

      - identity_verification_started
      - identity_verification_capture_completed
      - identity_verification_checks_completed
    
    ### Step 2: Create an applicant
    
    Set the value of `external_applicant_id` as `eaplt_61XXXA62XXX000000000000000`. Replace: 
    - `61XXX` with any of the response codes starting with 61 for the end of the first attempt
    - `62XXX` with any of the response codes starting with 62 for the final verdict
    
    For example, if you would like to test with `61203` and `62103`, then set the value to `eaplt_61203A62103000000000000000`.

    </div>
    
    #### Request example
    
    ```json
    {
      "external_applicant_id": "eaplt_61203A62103000000000000000",
      "email": "toby.arden@example.com"
    }
    ```   
    #### Response example
    
    ```json

        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 3: Create an identity verification
    
    Set the `id` you received in the step 1 response as the `applicant_id` value. For example, in this case the response returned `aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr1ab` as the `id`.

    </div>
    
    #### Request example
    
    ```json
    {
      "applicant_id": "aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr1ab",
      "declared_data": {
        "name": "Ali Farid",
        "birth_date": "1990-12-20"
      },
      "redirect_url": "https://example.com?query-param=hello",
      "webhook_url": "https://my.api/events/"
    }
    ```   
    #### Response example
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr1ab",
      "created_on": "2023-07-21T17:32:28Z",
      "modified_on": "2023-07-21T17:40:32Z",
      "applicant_id": "aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr1ab",
      "user_journey_id": "usj_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr1ab",
      "status": "pending",
      "response_codes": [],
      "declared_data": {
        "name": "Ali Farid",
        "birth_date": "1990-12-20"
      },
      "documents": [],
      "redirect_url": "https://example.com?query-param=hello",
      "webhook_url": "https://my.api/events/",
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.ubble.ai/v2/identity-verifications/idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr1ab"
        },
        "verification_url": {
          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 4: Create an attempt
    
    Pass the `id` from step 2 response as the path parameter.
    
    For example, in this case the response returned `idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr1ab` as the `id`.
    
    <div style="padding: 1em; background-color: #fafafa; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <span type="post" class="sc-EgOXT hniGzf http-verb post">post</span>
      <span class="sc-ejfMa-d jgeKJH">/v2/identity-verifications/{identity_verification_id}/attempts</span>
    </div>
    
    #### Request example
    
    ```json
    {
      "phone_number": {
        "country_code": "+1",
        "number": "2068133616"
      },
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello"
    }
    ```   
    
    At this stage, the webhooks for the first attempt are triggered. The `identity_verification_capture_aborted` webhook will return the response code starting with 61, that you passed as part of the `external_applicant_id`.
    
    #### Response example
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "iatp_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabrPoQ",
      "created_on": "2017-07-21T17:32:28Z",
      "modified_on": "2017-07-21T17:40:32Z",
      "phone_number": {
        "country_code": "+1",
        "number": "2068133616"
      },
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello",
      "status": "pending_redirection",
      "response_codes": [],
      "_links": {
        "verification_url": {
          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 5: Create another attempt
    
    When the `identity_verification_capture_aborted` webhook returns the `retry_required` status, create another attempt.
    
    To do this, pass the `id` from step 2 response as the path parameter.
    
    For example, in this case the response returned `idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr1ab` as the `id`.
    
    <div style="padding: 1em; background-color: #fafafa; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <span type="post" class="sc-EgOXT hniGzf http-verb post">post</span>
      <span class="sc-ejfMa-d jgeKJH">/v2/identity-verifications/{identity_verification_id}/attempts</span>
    </div>
    
    #### Request example
    
    ```json
    {
      "phone_number": {
        "country_code": "+1",
        "number": "2068133616"
      },
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello"
    }
    ```   
    #### Response example
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "iatp_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabrPoQ",
      "created_on": "2017-07-21T17:32:28Z",
      "modified_on": "2017-07-21T17:40:32Z",
      "phone_number": {
        "country_code": "+1",
        "number": "2068133616"
      },
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello",
      "status": "capture_in_progress",
      "response_codes": [],
      "_links": {
        "verification_url": {
          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    At this stage, webhooks for the final verdict are triggered. The `identity_verification_checks_completed` webhook will return the response code starting with 62 that you passed as part of the `external_applicant_id`.

    ### (Optional) Step 6: Retrieve an identity verification
    
    Pass the `id` value from step 2 response to the `identity_verification_id` path parameter.

    ```
    
    ## Declined verification on retry after checks inconclusive
    
    ### Step 1: Configure webhooks
    
    Have your webhook server ready to test real-time notifications for each event in this scenario. 
    
    Webhooks for first attempt:
    
      - identity_verification_created
      - identity_verification_opened
      - identity_verification_started
      - identity_verification_capture_completed
      - identity_verification_checks_inconclusive
    
    Webhooks for final verdict:
    
      - identity_verification_retry_requested
      - identity_verification_started
      - identity_verification_capture_completed
      - identity_verification_checks_completed
    
    ### Step 2: Create an applicant
    
    Set the value of `external_applicant_id` as `eaplt_61XXXI62XXX000000000000000`. Replace: 
    - `61XXX` with any of the response codes starting with 61 for the end of the first attempt
    - `62XXX` with any of the response codes starting with 62 for the final verdict
    
    For example, if you would like to test with `61203` and `62403`, then set the value to `eaplt_61203A62403000000000000000`.

        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 3: Create an identity verification
    
    Set the `id` you received in the step 1 response as the `applicant_id` value. For example, in this case the response returned `aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr6ft` as the `id`.

    }
    ```
    
    ### Step 4: Create an attempt
    
    Pass the `id` from step 2 response as the path parameter.
    
    For example, in this case the response returned `idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr6ft` as the `id`.

      },
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello"
    }
    ```   
    #### Response example

    }
    ```
    
    At this stage, the webhooks for the first attempt are triggered. The `identity_verification_checks_inconclusive` webhook will return the response code starting with 61, that you passed as part of the `external_applicant_id`.
    
    
    ### Step 5: Create another attempt
    
    When the `identity_verification_checks_inconclusive` webhook returns the `retry_required` status, create another attempt.
    
    To do this, pass the `id` from step 2 response as the path parameter.
    
    For example, in this case the response returned `idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr6ft` as the `id`.

    At this stage, webhooks for the final verdict are triggered. The `identity_verification_checks_completed` webhook will return the response code starting with 62 that you passed as part of the `external_applicant_id`.

    ### (Optional) Step 6: Retrieve an identity verification
    
    Pass the `id` value from step 2 response to the `identity_verification_id` path parameter.

    # Signature

    ## What is signed ?
    **Webhook notifications** are signed by default.

    To enable signature verification for **API responses**, contact your account manager.

    ## Cko-Signature Header
    The `Cko-Signature` header contains:
    - **Timestamp**: The time of the request (e.g., `1635236316.377888`).
    - **Signing Key ID and Version**: Unique key identifier and version (e.g., `3456-live-v1`).
    - **Signature**: The digital signature (e.g., `5257a869a7ecebeda35affa62cdcb3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff546d0ae8e108d8bd`).

    ### Signature Format
    ```
      <timestamp>:<organization_id>-<test or live verification>-<key version>:<signature>
    ```

    ### Signature example
    ```
      1635236316.377888:3456-production-v1:5257a869a7ecebeda35affa62cdcb3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff546d0ae8e108d8bd
    ```

    ### Signing Algorithm
    We use **ECDSA** with **SHA-512** to create signatures.

    ## Verifying the Signature
    1. **Download the Public Key**: Separate keys for test and live environments are available in the dashboard.
    2. **Recreate the Signed Data**: Combine the request body and the `Cko-Signature` timestamp.
    3. **Verify the Signature**: Use ECDSA with the downloaded public key to verify the signature.

    # API standards

    This section describes the standards we use to ensure the consistency of our API. 
    
    ## Required tag
    ### required
    Attributes tagged as `required` **MUST** be present in requests and responses.

    ### null values
    Attributes not marked as `required` can be null. In that case the attribute is not sent in the response.

    ## Resources identifiers
    ### Format
    `{prefix}_{lower-case base-32 encoded GUID}`

    ### Resources identifiers formatting

    | resource name          | prefix  | example                         |
    |------------------------|---------|---------------------------------|
    | applicants             | aplt    | aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we |
    | identity-verifications | idv     | idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we  |
    | aml-verifications      | amlv    | amlv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we |
    | user-journey           | usj     | usj_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we  |

    ## Content type
    The API accepts and returns `application/json` type.

    ## Error handling
    For HTTP error codes 400 and 422 the response body will contain:
    - `error_type`: a short description code
    - `error_codes`: a list of more detailed codes
    
    Error codes and error types can be formatted as follows:
    - `{error}`
    - `{target/attribute}__{error}`
    - `{nested_object}__{object_attribute}__{error}`

    ```json
    {
      "error_type": "invalid_request",
      "error_codes": [
        "birth_date__invalid_format",
        "first_name__required",
        "phone_number__country_code__invalid"
      ]
    }
    ````
