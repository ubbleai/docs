    # Introduction
    [Checkout.com](https://www.checkout.com/)'s Identity Verification solution enables you to verify your users' identities
    to meet compliance requirements and reduce the risk of fraud.
    
    To integrate Identity Verification and configure your account, reach out to your Account Manager or support.idv@checkout.com.

    The following represents a typical identity verification flow:

     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubbleai/docs/main/intro_diagram.png" alt="intro_diagram" width="800" height="auto">

    1. **You request an identity verification.** You'll receive a unique URL that you need to redirect the user to.
    2. **You redirect the user.** You have full control over how to [manage the verification redirection](#section/Manage-verification-redirection) to ensure a smooth user experience.
    The user performs verification on their mobile device. They'll use their device camera to scan their face and documents. 
    3. **You'll receive the [verification results](#section/Handle-verification-results) via a [webhook](#section/Webhooks).** You can also
    request more detailed results via the [API](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/retrieve_identity_verification),
    or download a [PDF report](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/pdf_identity_verification).
    4. **You decide on follow-up actions based on the verification results.** You can also reattempt the identity verification if required.

    You can also use our dedicated [dashboard](https://dashboard.ubble.ai/) to:
    - view and manage your identity verification activity
    - see detailed information on identification data

    # Get Started
    Use the Identity Verification API and sandbox environment to test the identity verification process.

    ## Request an identity verification and perform a test verification
    1. You request an identity verification.
    2. You receive a link which you can use to perform a test verification.
    3. You receive a webhook notification once the results of the verification are ready.
    4. You use the detailed results to make a decision on a follow-up action.

    ## Before you begin
    - Make sure you have a [test account](https://dashboard.ubble.ai/) and credentials. Open the [dashboard](https://dashboard.ubble.ai/)
    and navigate to the "API credentials" tab to create your credentials and your certificate. If you need an account, please contact support.idv@checkout.com.
    - We use mutual Transport Layer Security. You must then authenticate your calls by including your mTLS certificate in API calls.
    - To receive notifications for the various identity verification events triggered throughout the steps, you will need to define a
    webhook url. For security reasons all our webhook calls are signed, can be whitelisted or can even request an authentication.
    You will find all details about webhook implementation in the [webhook section](#section/Webhooks).
    - You'll also need to provide a redirect URL. The user will be redirected to this URL once verification is completed.

    ## Step 1: Request an identity verification
    To request an identity verification, you must include the following fields:
    - `name` - the full name provided by the user
    - `webhook_url` - the URL to get notifications
    - `redirect_url` - the URL to redirect the user to once verification is completed

    ### Request example

    ```json
    {
      "declared_data": {
        "name": "David Vincent"
      },
      "webhook_url": "https://my.api/events/",
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello"
    }
    ```

    ### Response example

    ```json
    {
      "id": "idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "created_on": "2017-07-21T17:32:28Z",
      "modified_on": "2017-07-21T17:40:32Z",
      "user_journey_id": "usj_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "applicant_id": "aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "status": "pending",
      "response_codes": [],
      "declared_data": {
        "name": "David Vincent",
        "birth_date": "1934-10-02"
      },
      "documents": [],
      "webhook_url": "https://my.api/events/",
      "redirect_url": "https://myweb.site?query-param=hello",
      "_links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.ubble.ai/v2/identity-verifications/idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we"
        },
        "applicant": {
          "href": "https://api.ubble.ai/v2/applicants/aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we"
        },
        "verification_url": {
          "href": "https://id.ubble.ai/4hryu5cei5/"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Make a note of the identity verification `id` value in the response. You'll need it to retrieve the detailed verification results later.

    For more details, see our the [request an identity verification endpoint](#tag/Identity-verifications).

    ## Step 2: Perform a test verification

    The identity verification response contains a `_links.verification_url.href` field. You should send the user to this URL to redirect them to the Identity Verification web application.

    To test this step, open the URL on your browser and follow the instructions displayed.
  
    ## Step 3: Verify webhook notifications

    If you've configured your webhook receiver, you'll be notified of events that occur during the identity verification flow via webhooks. Among other information, the webhooks will contain:
    - the event `type` - for example, `identity_verification_capture_completed` or `identity_verification_retry_requested`
    - the identity verification `status` - for example, `capture_in_progress`, `approved`, or `declined`

    ### Webhook example

    ```json
    {
        "specversion": "2.0",
        "type": "identity_verification_capture_completed",
        "subject": "idv_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
        "id": "evnt_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
        "time": "2023-03-22T17:31:00Z",
        "datacontenttype": "application/json",
        "data": {
            "applicant_id": "aplt_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
            "user_journey_id": "usj_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
            "identity_verification_id": "idv_5hxpdwegjcbujpth3wdo55d3vm",
            "status": "declined",
            "response_codes": [
                {"code": 61310, "summary": "document_front_not_captured"},
                {"code": 62102, "summary": "document_not_accepted"}
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

    Wait until you've received a webhook with the `status` field set to one of the following values before continuing to the next step:
    - `approved`
    - `declined`
    - `retry_required`

    ## Step 4: Retrieve detailed verification results

    To retrieve the detailed verification results, call the following endpoint with the identity verification id value returned in the Request an identity verification response. 

    ### Response example

    ```json
    {
      "id": "idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "created_on": "2017-07-21T17:32:28Z",
      "modified_on": "2017-07-21T17:40:32Z",
      "user_journey_id": "usj_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "applicant_id": "aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we",
      "status": "declined",
      "response_codes": [
        {

    For more details, see our the [retrieve an identity verification endpoint](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/retrieve_identity_verification). 

    # Manage verification redirection
    
    When you request an [identity verification](#section/Get-Started), you’ll receive a `verification_url` in the response. Redirect your user to this URL so they can perform the verification.

    To ensure a smooth user experience, you can control how the redirection is handled.

    ## Customize the verification user experience

    Contact your Account Manager or support.idv@checkout.com to customize the verification user experience.

    You can <a href="https://www.ubble.ai/customise-your-ubble-experience/" target="_blank">customize</a> the following elements on the verification screen displayed to your users:
    - logo
    - colors
    - fonts
    - button radius
    - message prompt text

    ## Redirect to mobile for verification

    All desktop users are redirected to their mobile device to perform verification. This allows the verification to be performed in a more secure environment, and ensures that users are more likely to complete the verification journey.

    After a user has completed the verification on their mobile, we redirect them back to their desktop environment by providing them with a QR code or SMS link.

    For the SMS link, you can provide a `phone_number` value in your [identity verification request](#operation/create_identity_verification) to pre-fill the phone number associated with the redirection.

    ## Redirect using web redirection (Optional)

    For web redirection, we support the following environments and minimum browser versions:

    | Desktop      | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Internet Explorer | Edge | Opera |
    |--------------|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|------|-------|
    | Min. Version | ≥ 53   | ≥ 52    | ≥ 11.1 | -                 | ≥ 16 | ≥ 58  |

    | Android      | Chrome for Android | Firefox for Android | Samsung Internet | IE Mobile |
    |--------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------|
    | Min. Version | ≥ 73               | ≥ 66                | ≥ 6.2            | -         |

    | iOS          | Safari Mobile | Chrome | All other browsers |
    |--------------|---------------|--------|--------------------|
    | Min. Version | ≥ 11.0        | ≥ 14.3 | -                  |

    After you create an identity verification in your backend, you can integrate it within your website by passing the `verificationUrl` to your web app and adding it as a link:

    ```html
    <a href="`${verificationUrl}`"></a>
    ```

    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #cfe5ff; border-color: #f8c92e; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; vertical-align: center;">ⓘ</div>
      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
        <p>You can view an <a href="https://github.com/ubbleai/integration_examples/tree/master/web" target="_blank">example web integration</a> on our Identity Verification GitHub repository.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    ### Handle user return in web redirection

    When the user completes or terminates their verification, they’ll be redirected to the `redirect_url` you specified when you requested an identity verification.

    The event associated with the user’s verification is returned in the webhook notification, and as a URL parameter in the `redirect_url`. If verification was unsuccessful, the URL will also contain a `response_code` URL parameter. For example:

    ```
    https://your-redirect-url.com?id=idv_01h2623ysfkhpn7czed0bw8fd6&event=identity_verification_capture_aborted&response_code=61101
    ```

    Your follow-up action is determined by the [webhook event](#section/Webhooks/Events) you receive:

    <table style="width: 100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 40%" scope="col">Webhook event</th>
          <th style="width: 60%" scope="col">Follow-up action</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p>
              <code>identity_verification_capture_aborted</code> or
              <code>identity_verification_link_expired</code>
            </p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>
              Request a
              <a
                href="#operation/retry_identity_verification"
                target="_self"
                >retry</a
              >.
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_refused</code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>Propose an alternative verification method to the user.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_completed </code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>
              You can ask users to perform additional checks or ask them to wait
              until results are available. In some instances, you may also
              simultaneously receive an
              <code>identity_verification_checks_completed</code> webhook.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can make your decision once you receive the
              <code>identity_verification_checks_completed</code> webhook.
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>


    ## Redirect using webview (Optional)

    For a more integrated redirection from your mobile application, you can redirect the user with a webview. Webview redirection is supported by the following platforms:
    - Android
    - iOS 13 or later – via WebRTC running inside a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview" target="_blank">WKWebView</a>
    - iOS 12 or older – via the Safari browser by passing the `verificationUrl` to the `UIApplication.open()`
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1648685-open" target="_blank">method</a> in your app code
    - React Native
    - Flutter – using the `flutter_inappwebview` <a href="https://inappwebview.dev/docs/intro/" target="_blank">dependency</a>,
    with the <a href="https://inappwebview.dev/docs/web-rtc/" target="_blank">WebRTC API</a> so Identity Verification can launch a video stream

    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #cfe5ff; border-color: #f8c92e; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; vertical-align: center;">ⓘ</div>
      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
        <p>You can view <a href="https://github.com/ubbleai/integration_examples/tree/master" target="_blank">example webview integrations</a> for each platform on our Identity Verification GitHub repository.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    With a webview integration, you’re expected to provide a deeplink to redirect the user on your mobile application.

    ### Handle user return in webview

    When the user completes or terminates their verification, they’ll be redirected to the `redirect_url` you specified when you requested an identity verification.

    The event associated with the user’s verification is returned in the webhook notification, and as a URL parameter in the `redirect_url`. If verification was unsuccessful, the URL will also contain a `response_code` URL parameter. For example:

    ```
    https://your-redirect-url.com?id=idv_01h2623ysfkhpn7czed0bw8fd6&event=identity_verification_capture_aborted&response_code=61101
    ```

    Your follow-up action is determined by the [webhook event](#section/Webhooks/Events) you receive:

    <table style="width: 100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 40%" scope="col">Webhook event</th>
          <th style="width: 60%" scope="col">Follow-up action</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 387.359px">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_aborted</code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 491.641px">
            <p>
              Request a
              <a
                href="#operation/retry_identity_verification"
                >retry.
              </a>
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_refused</code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>Propose an alternative verification method to the user.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="width: 40%">
            <p><code>identity_verification_capture_completed </code></p>
          </td>
          <td style="width: 60%">
            <p>
              You can ask users to perform additional checks, or ask them to wait
              until results are available. In some instances, you may also
              simultaneously receive an
              <code>identity_verification_checks_completed</code> webhook.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can make your decision once you receive the
              <code>identity_verification_checks_completed</code> webhook.
            </p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>




    ## Redirect using an iframe (Optional)

    If you use desktop to mobile redirection, we recommend using our iframe integration.

    Include the SDK as a script tag:

    ```html
    <script
      src="https://cdn.ubble.ai/iframe-sdk-1.0.0.js"
      type="application/javascript"
    ></script>
    ```

    Add a global method called `onUbbleReady` to the page. The method should be triggered when the SDK is loaded:

    ```js
    function onUbbleReady() {

    }
    ```

    Initialize a new `IDV` object:

    ```js
    function onUbbleReady() {
      const ubbleIDV = new Ubble.IDV(document.getElementById("ubble"), options);
    }
    ```

    ### API

    #### Events

    `onComplete(completeEvent)`: Triggered when a user completes the capture

    ```json

    #### Handle user redirection in iframe

    When the user completes or terminates their verification, use the `destroy()` method for handling user redirection.

    # Handle verification results

    When you request an identity verification, you'll be notified about events throughout the verification's lifecycle via webhooks.
    
    ## Verification statuses

    The webhooks also return the current `status` of the identity verification. The follow-up action you should take depends on the `status` value returned:

    <table style="width: 100%">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 25%" scope="col">Status</th>

    ## Response codes
    
    When the status is `retry_required`, `declined`, `refused` or `approved`, you will also get
    additional information in the webhook body with the `response_codes` attribute. It will
    include both a numeric code and a string, as detailed in the example below:

    ```json
    "response-codes": [
      {"code": 61310, "summary": "document_front_not_captured"},
      {"code": 62102, "summary": "document_not_accepted"},
    ]
    ```

    You will find below the exhaustive list of these codes.

    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #fff6d9; border-color: #f8c92e; color: #666; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; color: #f8c92e; vertical-align: center;">⚠</div>
      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
        <p>
          Please note that we consider adding new response codes as backward compatible.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    You should then build you business rules based on the status and use response codes as additional information, rather than use response codes as required information.

      }
    }
    ```

    For more details, see [retrieve identity-verification documentation](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/retry_identity_verification).

    We recommend that you use the response codes to guide the user. For example, if the [response codes](#section/Handle-verification-results/Response-codes)
    indicate that the connection of the user is not sufficient, you should give this information to the user.

    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #fff6d9; border-color: #f8c92e; color: #666; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
      <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; color: #f8c92e; vertical-align: center;">⚠</div>
      <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
        <p>You can only request a retry if the <code>status</code> is <code>retry_required</code>.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    ## Retrieve a PDF report

    When you receive an `identity_verification_checks_completed` webhook, we'll simultaneously generate a PDF report with detailed results of the identity verification.

    When the PDF report is ready for you to [retrieve via the API](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/pdf_identity_verification),
    you'll receive an `identity_verification_report_created` webhook.

    ## API response signing

    The API response signature can be activated by your account manager.
    
    This signature can be used to verify that the API response has been issued by Checkout.com and has not been altered.

    #### Verifying Response signature

    The `Cko-Signature` header contains:
    - the timestamp of the request, for example, `1635236316.377888`
    - the signing key identifier and version, for example, `3456-live-v1`
    - the signature itself, for example, `5257a869a7ecebeda35affa62cdcb3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff546d0ae8e108d8bd`

    Format of response signature:
    ```
      <timestamp>:<organization_id>-<test or live verification>-<key version>:<signature>
    ```

    Response signature example:
    ```
      1635236316.377888:3456-production-v1:5257a869a7ecebeda35affa62cdcb3fa51cad7e77a0e56ff546d0ae8e108d8bd
    ```

    We use an asymmetric key signing algorithm of type ECDSA with a sha2-512 hashing algorithm to sign the API response. 

    On your side, you can verify the signature against the received body by using the public key associated with the signature key. There are two public keys, for test verifications and live verifications respectively. You can download them from the client dashboard. 

    The keys have a validity of one year and will be automatically renewed. Upon renewal you will have to re-download the public key from the dashboard. 

    To detect a key rotation, look at the signature version in the API response. To verify that response, use the public key with the same version of the signature key. 

    Don’t worry about losing older versions of the public key, you can download all versions of the public key from the dashboard.
   
    #### Verifying Images
    You can also verify that the images has not been altered by using the image hashes available in the API response body.
    
    Images are hashed using the sha2-256 hashing algorithm and the same signature key than the one used to sign the API response.
    <div style="padding: 0px 0px 14px 14px ; background-color: #fff6d9; border-color: #f8c92e; color: #666; display: flex; align-items: center; border-radius: 0.5rem;">
    <div style="margin-right: 20px; margin-top: 14px; font-size: 30px; color: #f8c92e; vertical-align: center;">⚠</div>
    <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: center;">
      <p>For the data to be valid, both verification stages must be valid : the response signature verification and the images verification.</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    ## Data management

    You can configure data retention together with your account manager, in accordance with your purpose for using the data. At the end of this time, the identity verifications are anonymized, which means all personal or sensitive data are deleted. The default storage time is 90 days.
  
    If needed, you can also request the anonymization of an identity verification through the [anonymization endpoint](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/anonymize_identity_verification). 

    # Applicants

    ## Creation
    When you create an identity verification, an applicant is automatically created and the call returns an `applicant_id`.

    You can also directly create an applicant, using the [create endpoint](#tag/applicants/operation/create_applicant). In this case you will be able to define the `external_applicant_id`, that should correspond to the unique identifier of the applicant in your database, as well as the `mail` of the applicant.

    If the applicant is already created, you can also patch this information using the [update endpoint](#tag/applicants/operation/update_applicant).

    ## Applicant file 
    You can request several verifications for the same applicant. You only need to indicate the concerned `applicant_id` when creating the verification.

    If and only if an identity verification is `approved`, the verified identity is added to the `applicant` file. To find this information, use the [retrieve an applicant endpoint.](#tag/applicants/operation/retrieve_applicant).

    # Webhooks

    ## Configuration

    When [creating an identity verification](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/create_identity_verification), you need to provide the webhook url you want to be notified on.

    You will be notified of each event on identity verifications. For more details see the event section.

    To help you integrate your webhook you can trigger it with the standard answers, see [notify endpoint](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/notify_identity_verification).

    ## Body

    ## Retry

    We expect that you will return us a 200 or 201 status code within 10 seconds before we retry, up to 2 retries will be performed. If needed, you can trigger webhook notifications manually using the [notify endpoint](#tag/Identity-verifications/operation/notify_identity_verification).

    ## Signature
    For security reasons all our webhook calls are signed.
    
    `Cko-Signature` header contains the timestamp of the signature plus the signature itself. This allow you to ensure the content of the webhook was not modified.

    The header has the following format: "{timestamp}:{signature version}:{signature}" the format follows. Example: `1706285972.415666:1-test-v1:MIGGAkFt55yXjDDD0IFgVg+kH7++bJql/UfL8YcwOgaKvb0r/Zj/c/ULPKn7YUr3ddAi3PsCP2rPMnvEMBMGmPIB292nQgJBHR5H/Nk1BLWDvOf5VWjn+OmtU1J84m5NTvIxkkV9kcgyk1mUwUfAJGNoU5LhyYjBqwiU+CwkTVJa844qitcqhZg=`

    To compare the signature, you will need the webhook secret signature. There is one for signature for test verifications and one for live verifications. You can find them in the dashboard.

    ## Security

    ### Webhook IP whitelisting

    For security purposes, if you need to whitelist our incoming api calls, see our [public ip](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/OUTSCALE-Public-IPs.html).

    # API standards

    This section describes the standards we use to ensure the consistency of our API. 
    
    ## Required tag
    ### required
    Attributes tagged as `required` **MUST** be present in requests and responses.

    ### null values
    Attributes not marked as `required` can be null. In that case the attribute is not sent in the response.

    ## Resources identifiers
    ### Format
    `{prefix}_{lower-case base-32 encoded GUID}`

    ### Resources identifiers formatting

    | resource name          | prefix  | example                         |
    |------------------------|---------|---------------------------------|
    | applicants             | aplt    | aplt_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we |
    | identity-verifications | idv     | idv_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we  |
    | user-journey           | usj     | usj_tkoi5db4hryu5cei5vwoabr7we  |

    ## Content type
    The API accepts and returns `application/json` type.

    ## Error handling
    For HTTP error codes 400 and 422 the response body will contain:
    - `error_type`: a short description code
    - `error_codes`: a list of more detailed codes
    
    Error codes and error types can be formatted as follows:
    - `{error}`
    - `{target/attribute}__{error}`
    - `{nested_object}__{object_attribute}__{error}`

    ```json
    {
      "error_type": "invalid_request",
      "error_codes": [
        "birth_date__invalid_format",
        "first_name__required",
        "phone_number__country_code__invalid"
      ]
    }
    ````
